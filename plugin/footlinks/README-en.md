# Footlinks

En | [简](https://github.com/DahaWong/obsidian-footlinks/blob/main/README_zh.md)

*⚠️ Make sure you are using the latest version.*

![Demo](demo.png)

## Use
- Click the icon of Footlinks on the left side menu.
- Or, type command `Footlinks`.

## Preference
On `Footlinks` setting page, you can:
-  Add a seperator between **main body** and **footlinks**, say `---`. (stay empty by default)
- Decide whether the side menu icon is shown or not.

## Known Issues
1. Footlinks cannot be parsed by Obsidian in block quote, this could be considered as a bug of app. Just in case you are heavily using block quotes.
2. More issues please report on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/DahaWong/obsidian-footlinks/issues) or [Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/plugin-footlinks/9494) to let me know.
