# Copy Image and URL in Preview

This plugin creates a Copy Image and Copy URL context menu in preview mode in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

This makes copying URLs in prewiew like it is in edit mode by deafult. For copying images in edit mode check out [Ozan's Image in Editor Plugin](https://github.com/ozntel/oz-image-in-editor-obsidian)

Copying URLs also works on mobile, but was only tested on Android:

## Compatibility

The plugin was tested in Obsidian v0.11.13 and subsequent versions, but probably works with older versions.

## Installation

You can install the plugin via the Community Plugins tab within Obsidian.

You can also manually copy from releases to your `.obsidian/plugins/copy-url-in-preview` folder.
