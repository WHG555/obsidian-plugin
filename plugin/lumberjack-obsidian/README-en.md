## Lumberjack ðŸª“ ðŸªµ

Lumberjack helps you quickly jump from anywhere to logging something new in Obsidian. Its log command can be used from within the app to create a new line with a preset prefix at the end of your daily note and make sure you're in edit mode, so you can swiftly lodge whatever's on your mind away, and then get back to whatever you were doing.

The real power, though, is in its URL schemes. The clear-cut commands `obsidian://log` and `obsidian://timber` let you jump straight into edit mode on your daily note or a brand-new draft, respectively, with the cursor sharpened and ready to go in just the right place.
