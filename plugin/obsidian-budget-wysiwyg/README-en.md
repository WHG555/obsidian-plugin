# Budget WYSIWYG

Budget WYSIWYG is a plugin that automatically switches between preview mode and source mode based on if you are typing or not.


## How to use

Enable the plugin and start typing.

## Disclaimer

This is my first Obsidian plugin and I am still relatively new to js so there is probably a lot I can improve and it is probably not very efficient. I am aware of this and I will improve the plugin over time.
