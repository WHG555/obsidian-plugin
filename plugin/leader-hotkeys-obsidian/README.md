# Leader Hotkeys for Obsidian

Use a leader key when assigning a hotkey to a command. Works with any command
in Obsidian, even those added by other plugins!

The leader key is pressed before the assigned hotkey, similar to hotkeys in
tmux or Vim.

By default there is no leader key defined. I personally use
<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>b</kbd>, however you can configure any leader key in the
Obsidian Hotkeys settings page, just like any other hotkey.

By default the following commands are configured:

| Leader Hotkey                  | Action                     |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| <kbd>leader</kbd> <kbd>j</kbd> | Focus on pane below        |
| <kbd>leader</kbd> <kbd>k</kbd> | Focus on pane above        |
| <kbd>leader</kbd> <kbd>h</kbd> | Focus on pane to the left  |
| <kbd>leader</kbd> <kbd>l</kbd> | Focus on pane to the right |
