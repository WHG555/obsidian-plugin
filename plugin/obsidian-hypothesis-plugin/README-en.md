### Features

- Sync article highlights on Obsidian startup or manual trigger
- Update existing articles with new highlights and annotations
- Customization highlights through [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks) template

## Usage

After installing the plugin, configure the the settings of the plugin then initiate the first sync manually. Thereafter, the plugin can be configured to sync automatically or manually

### Settings

- `Connect`: Enter [API Token](https://hypothes.is/account/developer) in order to pull the highlights from Hypohesis
- `Disconnect`: Remove API Token from Obsidian
- `Highlights folder`: Specify the folder location for your Hypothesis articles
- `Sync on startup`: Automatically sync highlights when open Obsidian
- `Highlights template`: Nunjuck template for rendering your highlights
- `Reset sync`: Wipe your sync history. Does not delete any previously synced highlights from your vault

### To sync all new highlights since previous update

- Command: Sync new highlights
- Click: Hypothesis ribbon icon

## Limitations

Limit to 100 highlights per sync for performance. Pagination of result sets in the API does not seem to work. Hopefully, this will be fixed in their API v2.0
