## Usage

A statblock may be defined in a note using the syntax below.

All fields are optional - if not provided, that Statblock will simply not render them.

The `monster` field may be combined with other fields to override the field. See [Overriding Fields](#Overriding-Fields).

The spellcasting trait requires a special field (`spells`) - See [Spellcasting](#Spellcasting)

```statblock
monster: <SRD Monster Name>

```
````

### Spellcasting

The spellcasting trait requires a special `spells` field using the following syntax:

> **Please Note:**
>
> Overriding an existing monster's spells replaces the spells, _it does not combine_.

````
```statblock
spells:
    - The archmage is an 18th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). The archmage can cast disguise self and invisibility at will and has the following wizard spells prepared
