# Overview

This plugin accompanies [Minimal Theme](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal), allowing you to customize the theme from the Obsidian Settings panel. This plugin is not required to use Minimal Theme, but highly recommended.

# Usage

- Requires Minimal Theme 2.0.0 minimum
- Minimal Theme works hand-in-hand with [Hider Plugin](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-hider) to simplify the Obsidian UI by removing the menu ribbon, tooltips, title bar, scrollbars, etc. This functionality was previously included in Minimal Theme but has now been separated out.

# Settings

## Accent color

- Control the accent color hue and saturation. This color is used for interactive elements such as links, buttons, text selections, and more.
- **Fancy cursor** can be toggled on or off to make your editor cursor use the accent color.

## Background colors

Several options are available for light mode and dark mode. These options can be toggled via customizable hotkeys.

- **Default** uses a slighty darker background for the sidebar
- **Low contrast** uses the same background for sidebar and main panel
- **High contrast (light mode only)** uses dark sidebar and light main panel
- **True black (dark mode only)** uses pure black sidebar and main panel

## Editor and monocode font
- System fonts
- [iA Writer fonts](https://ia.net/downloads#fonts) (must be downloaded and installed separately)
