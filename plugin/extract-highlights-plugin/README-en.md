### How it works
This plugin will copy the highlights delimited by `==`, `**` and `<mark></mark>` into your clipboard as a bullet-list. 

Optionally you can customize...

* **The heading text of the list**, include the note-title or hide it all-together
* **Adding a footnote** to each that link back to the source-file 
* **Creating an ad-hoc map-of-content (MOC)** by turning each highlight into an `[[` Obsidian link `]]`  
* **Auto-capitalize** the first letter in each highlight for consistency

### Demo Creating and Extracting Highlights

1. First you see how I use the CREATE highlights hot-key to highlight sentences
2. Then you see how I use the EXTRACT highlights hot-key to create a new file with the highlights

![basic functionality](https://github.com/akaalias/extract-highlights-plugin/blob/master/highlight.gif?raw=true)

#### Using the Hotkey to HIGHLIGHT (and UN-HIGHLIGHT) the sentence under cursor

The default hotkey for this is: 

<kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>_</kbd>

Super useful for when you're reading and just don't want to switch to your mouse for selecting the sentence. 

![demo](https://github.com/akaalias/extract-highlights-plugin/blob/master/onoff.gif?raw=true)

Will remove highlighting if the sentence under your cursor is currently delimited by "==".

#### Using the Hotkey to EXTRACT highlights

The default hotkey is: 

<kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>ALT</kbd> + <kbd>=</kbd>

#### Using the Ribbon Button
There is also a button (a circle-shape) that's added to your left-side ribbon. 

Clicking on it will also extract all highlighted parts in your current note and place it in your clipboard.

#### Using the Command Palette
I looked into it and there’s a bug the way clipboard works with the Command Palette. Basically everything but the “Paste” works.

But I’ve found a temporary work-around. It’s weird but it works.

1. Trigger Command Palette (Command-P)
2. Find “Extract Highlights”
3. Hit Enter (You should see a notification (“Highlights copied to clipboard!”)
4. Workaround: At this point, briefly switch to a different note and back (This materialises the clipboard data for pasting)
5. Paste works now the same as with the Hotkey and Button-press

#### Pasting highlights from your clipboard

After using the hotkey, button or command palette, anywhere you want, just paste the clipboard!

<kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>v</kbd> (MacOS) or the equivalent on Windows/Linux

The output is a markdown-block titled "Highlights" with a bullet-list of the highlights.
