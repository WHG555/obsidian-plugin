Plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

When you use the mouse on a button this plugin will show a notification with the assigned shortcut for that action.

For buttons that don't have shortcuts assigned the plugin
will show you the name of the command to assign in the settings.

>‚ùï Due to similarities in command names you might get multiple
different notifications for one button.

Based on the [Key Promoter X](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9792-key-promoter-x) plugin for IntelliJ IDEA.

### Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/key-promoter/`.
