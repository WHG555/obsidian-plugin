You can set reminders for TODO list items with the following format.

```markdown

- [ ] Also you can specify time (@2021-08-14 09:37)

```

If you input `(@` (start of the reminder date time), calendar popup to set the reminder date time will show.

#### Interoperability with other plugins

In addition to original format `@YYYY-MM-DD`, this plugin also supports following plugin formats.

- [Obsidian Tasks](https://github.com/schemar/obsidian-tasks) (e.g. `ðŸ“… 2021-05-02`)
- [Kanban](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) (e.g. `@{YYYY-MM-DD}`)

They can be enabled by `Reminder Format` section in setting.
