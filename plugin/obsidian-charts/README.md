This Plugin lets you create interactive Charts in [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md).

## Usage

To create a Chart within Obsidian a Codeblock of the type `chart` is used. The Properties are set using YAML Syntax. Example:

```yaml
    ```chart
        type: ""
        labels: []
        series:
          - title: ""
            data: []
          - title: ""
            data: []

    ```
```

The `title` Property _can_ be omitted, but it is not advised to do so.

> You might **not** be able to copy the Examples directly into Obsidian, the Indentation is probably wrong and Obsidian tries to convert pasted Text to Markdown, which escapes a few important characters.

### Graphical Chart Creator

For simple Charts you can use the graphical Chart Creator, you can access it via the Command Palette or you can even set a Hotkey!

### Legacy Mode

For anyone who has used this Plugin before the Release of v2.0.0, there is a legacy Mode so you don't need to manually convert your old Charts to the new Syntax. Just add `legacy: true` to your old Charts. **Please do not use this for new Charts, legacy Mode might get removed in future Versions.**

### Chart Types

This Plugin provides 6 different Variants. The type of a Chart is set by the `type: {Type}` Property.

#### Line Chart

```yaml
    ```chart
        type: line
        labels: [Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday]
        series:
          - title: Title 1
            data: [1,2,3,4,5]
          - title: Title 2
            data: [5,4,3,2,1]
          - title: Title 3
            data: [8,2,5,-1,4]
    ```
```

The above example Code will render a _Line Chart_ with 3 individual traces, titled "Title 1", "Title 2" and "Title 3".

#### Bar Chart

```yaml
    ```chart
        type: bar
        labels: [Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday, Saturday, Sunday, "next Week", "next Month"]
        series:
          - title: Title 1
            data: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
          - title: Title 2
            data: [5,4,3,2,1,0,-1,-2,-3]
    ```
```

The above example Code will render a _Bar Chart_.

#### Radar Chart

```yaml
    ```chart
        type: radar
        labels: [Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday]
        series:
          - title: Title 1
            data: [1,2,3,4,5]
          - title: Title 2
            data: [5,4,3,2,1]
        width: 40%
    ```
```

The above example Code will render a _Radar Chart_, a `width` Modifier is already added, since this Chart would be way to big otherwise.

#### Doughnut and Pie Chart

```yaml
    ```chart
        type: pie
        labels: [Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday]
        series:
          - title: Title 1
            data: [1,2,3,4,5]
          - title: Title 2
            data: [5,4,3,2,1]
        width: 40%
        labelColors: true
    ```
```

The above example Code will render a _Pie Chart_, a `width` Modifier is already added, since this Chart would be way to big otherwise. The Property `labelColors` is also set to `true`, which is the desired behaviour most of the time.

![Pie Chart Example Image](images/piechart.png)

```yaml
    ```chart
        type: doughnut
        labels: [Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday]
        series:
          - title: Title 1
            data: [1,2,3,4,5]
          - title: Title 2
            data: [5,4,3,2,1]
        width: 40%
        labelColors: true
    ```
```

The above example Code will render a _Doughnut Chart_, a `width` Modifier is already added, since this Chart would be way to big otherwise. The Property `labelColors` is also set to `true`, which is the desired behaviour most of the time.

#### Polar Area Chart

```yaml
    ```chart
    type: polarArea
    labels: [Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday]
    series:
      - title: Title 1
        data: [1,2,3,4,5]
      - title: Title 2
        data: [5,4,3,2,1]
    labelColors: true
    width: 40%
    ```
```

The above example Code will render a _Polar Area Chart_, a `width` Modifier is already added, since this Chart would be way to big otherwise. The Property `labelColors` is also set to `true`, which is the desired behaviour most of the time.

### Modifiers

#### `width` Modifier

The `width` Modifier is used to set the width of **any** Chart. It is advised to use it for the following Charts:

The Values can be any valid CSS Property, for examples fixed Values (e.g. `400px`) or dynamic Values (e.g `40%`).

## Customization

### Changing Colors

Right now the Colors cannot be changed, I am working on implementing Color Pickers for a Settings Tab, so the Colors can be customized again.

### Interactivity

**All** Charts are interactive.

- You can click the different Graphs inside the Legend to make them dissappear (and reappear)
- You can hover over the Chart to see more detailed information
