## Obsidian Extended MathJax

This plugin extends the MathJax support in Obsidian with a MathJax preamble file which is loaded at startup. It also enables some additional MathJax extensions (notably `mhchem` and `bussproofs`). 

The preamble is stored in a `preamble.sty` file in the root of the vault. To reload changes to the preamble refresh the vault using `Cmd + R` / `Ctrl + R`. 

### Installation 

1. Install 'Extended MathJax' from the Obsidian community plugin browser.
2. Create a `preamble.sty` file in the root of your vault using your choice of text editor.
3. Add your macros to `preamble.sty`

### Changing your preamble

If you make changes to your preamble you will need to reload it. To do this run `âŒ˜ + R` / `Ctrl + R` to refresh Obsidian. This will reload all your obsidian plugins and update your preamble. 

### Example

Look at `examples/stlc` for an example of an obsidian vault using a preamble to define custom macros.
