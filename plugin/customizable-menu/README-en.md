# Obsidian Customizable Right Click Menu

This plugin allows you to add any commands, including those of plugins, to the right click menu and assign custom icons to them.

## Custom Icons

If the command doesn't yet have any icon, you can select from a range of icons, including Obsidian's internal icons and all Feather Icons.

## Thanks
This plugin is a fork of phibr0's excellent [customizable sidebar](plugin).
