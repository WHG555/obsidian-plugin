# Garble Text

This plugin exposes the `garbleText()` function in Obsidian. Use the commands palette (`ctrl+p`) to find the function **Toggle Garble Text**.

Garbling text in Obsidian turns all content in the entire app (notes, sidebar, etc) into unreadable text (and blurs images) so you can take screenshots without exposing sensitive data.

Garbled text is ungarbled on hover.

## To-Dos

- Add an editor toolbar icon for mobile
- Regex-based garbling
- Setting to change garbled display font
