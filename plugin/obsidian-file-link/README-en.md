# Better File Link

With this Obsidian plugin you can easily add file links to your notes. It features an interface to select files right from within Obsidian. No need to open a new Finder/File Explorer window to manually drag and drop files to your note.

Other features and settings to improve file links:
- custom prefix shown before every file link when adding multiple files
- toggle visibility of file endings
- decide if the file link should open the file or the folder where the file is located in

This plugin has only been tested on macOS and will only work on macOS. Other OS support will be available in future releases.

1. Open command palette with "cmd + p"
2. Search for the command "Add file link"
3. CLick "Select files"
4. Now choose your files
5. Then press "Add file link"
