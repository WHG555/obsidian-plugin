# Obsidian HackerNews [![GitHub tag (Latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/arpitbbhayani/obsidian-hackernews)](https://github.com/arpitbbhayani/obsidian-hackernews/releases) ![GitHub all releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/arpitbbhayani/obsidian-hackernews/total)

The plugin periodically fetches and displays top stories from [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) in an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) pane. Some of the best stories, blogs, news, and resources are shared on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/), and this plugin helps stay updated while using Obsidian.

# Features

 - Periodically fetches a random top story from HackerNews.
 - You can save the story as a note allowing you to revisit it again.

# Installation

 - Search for *Open HackerNews* and run the command.
 - You will see that a new View appears in the right Sidebar of Obsidian.

# Is this plugin for you?

This plugin is for you if you use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and
 - are a passionate engineer
 - want to discover amazing articles, resources, and projects
 - want to stay updated with the happenings in the tech world


# Why I created this plugin?
I love reading technical articles and stay updated with the latest happenings in the tech world, and I find [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) ideal for this. I have read some of the best articles and found amazing open source libraries through it, and hence I always like to keep a clock eye on HackerNews.

On Mac, I used [YCombinator Plugin](https://github.com/martinsirbe/ycombinator-bitbar) on [BitBar](https://xbarapp.com/), which is very similar and shows one top story from [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) in the top menu bar. If the title is enticing enough, I can always learn more about it by clicking the item. This is a great way for me to discover the best resources out there.

Recently, I switched to a Windows machine and found it not having a similar utility; plus, writing a widget for Windows is a mess. When I discovered Obsidian, I found myself using it quite frequently. So I thought of creating a plugin similar to the [YCombinator Plugin](https://github.com/martinsirbe/ycombinator-bitbar) to fetch random top story from HackerNews and show it to me in the side pane.

This is how this Plugin was conceptualized, and now my Obsidian workspace looks like this.
