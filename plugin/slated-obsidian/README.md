# Slated for Obsidian

## âš  Project Archived

Afer much thought and experimentation, I have decided to change directions with how I manage tasks in Obsidian. The approach I am taking now is different enough that I felt it warranted a new plugin, rather than adapting Slated and foisting it on the existing users. The new plugin is called [tq](https://github.com/tgrosinger/tq-obsidian) and is availalbe in the community plugins list.

If you would like to carry on the torch of Slated, please reach out to me and we can discuss un-archiving this repository.

Thank you for your understanding and support!

## How to use

Tasks are created using normal markdown syntax, for example `- [ ] Water the
plants`. Once a task is created, configure repetition or move the task using
the commands added by this plugin. This is easiest to do by either binding
them to a hotkey, or using the command palette.

Repetition configs can also be edited manually, however using the interface
helps ensure a valid repetition config has been created.

Tasks can also be moved to another day.
