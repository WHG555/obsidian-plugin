# Obsidian Plugin: Convert a URL into markdown

![Demo](demo-extract-url.gif)

Transforms a URL to markdown view if the website allows it.

# Installation

Available in the community plugin store in options.

# Modes

Operates in 2 modes.

1. **Selection** - If you select a URL in the document and execute these commands it will replace the selection with the markdown content.
2. **Document** - If you add front mater with the key of `link` to your document then it is treated as a linked document. Then calling extract will look for the link and replace the content of the document with the extracted content.
