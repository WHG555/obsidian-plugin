# Obsidian Filename Heading Sync

This is a Obsidian plugin to keep the filename and the first heading of a file in sync

**Note**: This plugin will overwrite your first heading at the top of the file the moment you open it, so this can be considered _destructive_.

Discussion on the obsidian forum [here](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/plugin-for-keeping-the-filename-and-first-heading-of-a-file-in-sync/12042)

## Features

- When renaming the current file -> will update the heading
- When opening a file that doesn't have a heading yet -> will insert one
- When opening a file with a different heading than the current file -> will update the heading
- When updating the heading of a file -> will rename the file

## Current limitations and to do

- Doesn't work yet when editor is in preview mode
- When renaming a file that isn't the current file, nothing will happen. The heading will get updated the next time the file is saved
- [Special characters](https://github.com/dvcrn/obsidian-filename-header-sync/blob/bc3a1a7805f2b63ad5767c3d01dcef7b65b1aebd/main.ts) that obsidian can't handle will get auto-stripped
