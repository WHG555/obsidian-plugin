# Code Editor Shortcuts

This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin adds keyboard shortcuts (hotkeys) commonly found in code editors such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.

| Insert line above                                | `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Enter` |

| Transform selection to uppercase                 | Not set                    |
| Transform selection to lowercase                 | Not set                    |

\*\* This may conflict with the default shortcut for _Toggle checklist status_; changing/removing one of the bindings is recommended
