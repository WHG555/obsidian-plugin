Hide secrets in your [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) notes.

This plugin allows you to encrypt portions of text so you can store sensitive details within and alongside your notes.

Under the hood it uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in GCM mode.

> WARNING: Use at your own risk.
> - Your passwords are never stored anywhere, if you forget your password you can't decrypt your text.
> - There haven't been any audits for the soundness of encryption methods being used.  Unwanted decryption by a 3rd party may still be possible if they have access to your files.
